    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>I'am dedicating my retirement years to learn computer programming. I like to read and watch Major league Baseball when relaxing</p>

    <h1>My Skills</h1>
    <p class="skills">I started to learn to code in late 2022 after retiring and looking to learn a new skill that involved a heavy dose of critical thinking and was something I had never embarked on in the past.<br>
      I also wanted something that would involve continual learning, challenge my resolve, and was relavent in the 21st century.<br>
      I found that computer programming was something I was interested in and allowed me to work and study in the home while aquiring this new skill.
      Currently I am studying front end web development.
